# Pygame-Tetris
For learning purposes I programmed Tetris using Pygame. I am currently learning Python and Pygame seemed simple enough library
that I decided to use it to code some simple game, and Tetris was the first to pop into my mind. 

So the code is probably not that interesting, since I don't make that much use of Pygame (mainly drawing and handling events), and it
lacks UI since I wasn't prepared to spend time working on one.

Pieces are moved left and right by left and right arrow. Spacebar makes the piece rotate (if possible) and pressing down key makes
the piece go immediately to bottom.
